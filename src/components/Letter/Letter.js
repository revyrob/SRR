          Your help is needed in lobbying the BC Government to request that the
          proposed West High Yield Resources (WHY) Record Ridge magnesium mine
          be categorized as a mineral mine and subject to a formal environmental
          assessment.{" "}

        <p>
          WHY Resources is attempting to categorize their proposed mine as an
          “industrial mineral mine” and not a “mineral” mine. So what is the
          significance of this? In British Columbia, the difference between a
          project categorized as a mineral mine and one categorized as an
          industrial mineral mine lies in what is being extracted. Mineral mines
          primarily focus on extracting metals (like magnesium), precious
          stones, and other valuable minerals such as gold, silver, copper, and
          diamonds. On the other hand, industrial mineral mines are involved in
          extracting non-metallic minerals used in various industrial
          applications such as construction, manufacturing, and agriculture.
          These industrial minerals include limestone, gypsum, silica, potash,
          and various types of aggregates.The Environmental Assessment Act sets
          out the thresholds for mandatory environmental assessment for mining
          projects. The act requires that certain mining projects undergo an
          environmental assessment to evaluate potential environmental,
          economic, social, heritage, and health effects. The thresholds for
          mandatory environmental assessment are determined based on the
          category of mine, its size and potential impacts of the proposed
          mining activities.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          For ‘mineral’ mines in BC, a mandatory environmental assessment is
          triggered when the proposed production exceeds 75,000 tonnes per year
          whereas for ‘industrial mineral’ mines, the threshold for mandatory
          environmental assessment is much higher at 250,000 tonnes per year.WHY
          has applied for their magnesium mine to be categorized as an
          industrial mineral mine with a production of 200,000 tonnes per year.
          If they are successful, the mine will not require an environmental
          assessment as it will be under the threshold of 250,000 tonnes per
          year.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Our group asserts that the WHY project should be categorized as a
          mineral mine, because it is mining magnesium, which is a metal, and it
          fits the definition of a mineral mine under BC regulations. We add
          that it does not fit the definition of an industrial mineral mine
          under the BC regulations. Lastly, the Cogburn magnesium project
          outside of Hope, BC was very similar to the Record Ridge project and
          was correctly categorized as a mineral mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have made formal submissions to the BC Environmental Assessment
          Office, advocating for the correct categorization of the Record Ridge
          project as a mineral mine and asking that it be subjected to a
          mandatory environmental assessment as the proposed production exceeds
          75,000 tonnes per year.
        </p>
        <p>
          We need your help to let the Province know that this project should be
          categorized in line with the established legal and regulatory
          frameworks and that it should undergo a full environmental assessment.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Add your voice to ours by reaching out to representatives in the
          Provincial Government to express your concerns on this matter. We
          expect that the decision on categorization will be made in the coming
          days or weeks.{" "}
