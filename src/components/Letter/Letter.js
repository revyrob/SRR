        <p>
          As a local community member I am extremely concerned with the open pit
          mine that West High Yield (WHY) Resources Ltd. is proposing to open in
          the Record Ridge area, on the unceded territory of the Sinixt and
          other First Nations, near Rossland, Paterson and Sheep Creek, BC. The
          proposed mine could have significant negative impacts on the quality
          of life, safety, health, economy, and well-being of all the residents.
          In addition, the proposed mine will threaten an already fragile alpine
          and grassland ecosystems and watershed.{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>Water</h4>
        <p>
          Having clean water is a right that all Canadians have. Many properties
          around that watershed access surface or well water. With the proposed
          mine location, there is an increased risk that runoff from the mine
          could contaminate that watershed, either immediately or in the future.
          This could result in homeowners bearing the costs of finding an
          alternative way to get clean water. In addition, water is already
          scarce in the Rossland area during the summer months. If the proposed
          mine requires the use of any water, this will add significant pressure
          to an already taxed system. Along with risking the drinking water of
          residents, the proposed mine could also destroy fish habitat and the
          water supply for the wildlife in the area. Under the Water
          Sustainability Act, everyone needs a water license. How will the
          watershed be protected, monitored, and sustained? What measures will
          the province put in place to ensure the current and future protection
          of that watershed?{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <h4>Dust</h4>
        <p>
          The amount of dust that will be created from the blasting, crushing,
          loading, and hauling activity will be significant. The local residents
          living nearest the mine site, such as those families in Paterson, will
          be constantly exposed to dust and airborne chemicals in the dust. How
          will dust be mitigated at the mine site? How will the dust be
          monitored for harmful contaminants? How will the province ensure local
          residents have their homes, vehicles, and yards regularly cleaned from
          excess dust from mining activity?
        </p>
        <h4>Asbestos and Other Airborne Chemicals</h4>
        <p>
          Within the ore, there are proven traces of asbestos. With trucks
          driving through the center of town, estimated at every 7-10 minutes, 7
          days per week, exposure to asbestos, or other chemicals in the ore
          dust, is possible. Any exposure to asbestos is a serious health risk.
          The tests that have been done, although they might be according to the
          minimum regulations, are not enough to ensure that exposure to
          asbestos is not a threat to our communities. How will the government
          evaluate the contradicting reports of asbestos at the mine site? How
          will the government monitor potential asbestos contamination at the
          mine site and in the transport trucks traveling through our
          communities? How will dust be monitored for such chemicals?
        </p>{" "}
        <h4>Noise Pollution</h4>
        <p>
          The noise from weekly blasting and daily crushing and hauling on a
          mine site that is 7.5 kilometers from the community of Rossland and
          only 2 kilometers from the community of Paterson will have an
          extremely negative impact on the quality of life for all residents.
          Moreover, the proposed mine site is only 200 meters from our epic
          trail, Seven Summits, which is traversed by locals and tourists daily.
          This noise will affect the patrons of the trail significantly. In
          addition, the noise pollution from the heavy truck traffic through
          Rossland, Paterson, and Trail will negatively impact all residents.
          What will the province do to mitigate this noise in our communities?
          How can the mine site be altered to buffer sound? Is it possible to
          reduce hours of operation, including hauling, to be consistent with a
          typical work schedule, thus permitting some regard for residents?
        </p>{" "}
        <h4>Transportation of Ore</h4>
        <p>
          With the proposed 80 ore-truck trips a day throughout Paterson and
          Rossland, I am specifically concerned about road infrastructure and
          the safety of citizens. The town of Rossland will carry the burden of
          heavy traffic throughout town, affecting businesses, residents, and
          homeowners. If the trucks are rerouted through Paterson, that
          community will be negatively impacted. It is a farming community with
          tractors and equipment sharing the road. How will the province ensure
          the safety of community members, mitigate the negative impact of
          increased heavy traffic on tourism, and reduce potential noise from
          the big trucks?{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the dust generated by the ore trucks hauling material on
          the gravel road of cascade highway and through communities has the
          potential to greatly affect air quality. It could also create a
          blanket of dust on residents' homes, community sidewalks, and
          storefronts. As queried earlier, how will the province ensure dust
          from the ore trucks is mitigated? And how will the province ensure
          that the homes and communities are kept clean?{" "}
        </p>
        <h4>Economic Impacts</h4>
        <p>
          Rossland has been named one of the best small mountain towns in Canada
          to live in, according to Map Quest Travel, and has worked hard to
          establish itself as a travel and tourist destination.. Rossland
          accommodation revenue from tourism reached a record in 2022, where
          “Total accommodation revenue was $9.5 million, a 40 percent increase
          over the best year prior to the pandemic in 2019.” (Rossland News May
          26, 2023). Rossland residents have invested significantly over the
          last 20+ years in the city center and surrounding trails, parks, and
          recreation areas to become a four-season outdoor recreation
          destination. Many shops and services, and economic activity in
          general, are focused on catering to this market. Many of the residents
          of Rossland choose to live here because of the quality of life that
          the area offers (ie, close access to wild nature, peace and quiet,
          clean water, calm streets, world-class winter and summer recreation
          possibilities, including trails that are tourist attractions).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Rossland is a popular tourist destination for mountain biking and all
          types of skiing. In 2012, Rossland was named the “Mountain Biking
          Capital of Canada'' by Explore Magazine. Tourism in Rossland in 2011,
          recorded that out-of-town mountain bikers spent a total of $589,000,
          which significantly contributed to the community’s revenues and added
          to provincial revenues (Tourism BC, 2013). Since that time, mountain
          biking revenues have continued to climb and are a major contributing
          factor to the local economy and community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proposed mine would have a detrimental impact on access to and use
          of the biking trails, and ski touring in the area of Record Ridge. In
          particular, the Seven Summits Trail would be destroyed given its close
          proximity to the proposed mine. It is uncertain how the growth of the
          mine will further impact trail riding. WHY representatives have
          proposed closing the Seven Summits trail during blasting or moving the
          trail. It is unclear how all potential trail users would be notified
          of the blasting, which could result in major safety concerns for local
          or visiting patrons of the trail. Moving or closing the trail could
          jeopardize the trail’s status and impact its value. Just having the
          mine pit within sight of the trail will take away from the experience.
          Moreover, there are major pick-up and drop-off points for the mountain
          biking trails along the Cascade Highway. In 2007, Seven Summits Trail
          was named “Trail of the Year” by Bike Magazine. In 2011, Tourism BC
          conducted research on mountain biking in Rossland. They determined
          that Seven Summits was the most popular trail in the community, with
          61% of respondents reporting that they visited the trail during their
          stay in Rossland. The trail was one of the top five reasons for
          Rossland's biking popularity. The respondents were non-local riders.
          The study concluded that 90% of travelers to the area reported that
          the single most important factor in their decision to visit Rossland
          was mountain biking. The majority also reported that they would return
          to bike, given their experience. At that time, Rossland was reported
          to be exceeding consumers' expectations for the biking experience.
          Since 2011, Rossland has invested significant time and resources into
          the trail. Currently, Seven Summits Trail is the only mountain biking
          trail in the Kootenays with the international Mountain Biking
          Association (IMBA) “Epic Status.” Canada only has four trails of this
          status. This draws tourism and recreation from across the globe. In
          addition, the mine’s existence and location would have a seriously
          detrimental effect on The Broken Goat, the annual trail race based in
          Rossland on the Seven Summits Trail.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, the mine could destroy a tremendous amount of the tourism
          industry in Rossland and negatively impact associated businesses. It
          could potentially reduce the lifestyle, mental health, and physical
          health of the local residents.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, research also shows that our property values could
          decrease by as much as 30%, due to our proximity to the open pit mine.
          This further impacts local communities and investors. In exchange, the
          only benefit that the representatives from the mine could identify for
          residents of Rossland, Warfield, Trail, Paterson, and Sheep Creek was
          approximately 30 seasonal jobs. We would lose far more than that many
          jobs from the destruction of the very environment that enables our
          thriving tourism industry.
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          How can the government ensure that the recreational and tourism
          backbone of our community is not negatively impacted by Record Ridge
          Mine? How will the government compensate for lost revenues and job
          loss in this sector? How will the government ensure the safety of all
          trail users, local and non-local during blasting times? How will the
          integrity and experience of the world-famous Seven Summits Trail be
          maintained? Within three kilometers of the mine site, there is a Girl
          Guides Canada camp, which has been an established camping site for our
          children and children from around Canada for many years. This
          recreation site is used by children all summer long for excursions,
          learning wilderness safety skills, and general camping events. They
          depend on the water on site for drinking, bathing, and cleaning. The
          noise and dust pollution will take away from their recreational
          experience. How will the province mitigate the mining effects on this
          recreational component of our community?
        </p>
        <h4>Farm Land</h4>
        <p>
          Paterson and Sheep Creek areas are home to some of the only viable
          farmland Rossland has access to. This land is not protected by the
          ALR. This agricultural land is at risk of being negatively impacted by
          noise, dust, and water pollution. How will the province ensure that
          the impact of the mine will not affect agricultural production of this
          land and mitigate the effects of dust, noise, and water pollution for
          the cattle, horses, and poultry of these farms?
        </p>
        <h4>First Nations’ Land Rights and UNDRIP</h4>
        <p>
          This proposed mine directly impacts the Sinixt people and their future
          generations. It is their land we call home and it is their right to
          protect it. This is their traditional unceded territory and they need
          to be meaningfully consulted. A representative of the Sinixt came to
          the community open house in Rossland on the evening of May 17th to
          express in very strong and heartfelt words that the band DOES NOT WANT
          IT. How will the province ensure that these indigenous people’s voices
          are considered?
        </p>
        <h4>Grassland, endangered species, and unique ecosystem</h4>
        <p>
          The grassland deserves further study and has culturally significant
          flora and endangered grasslands. There is a SARA S1 listed plant –
          Mountain Holly Fern (Threatened) – that has multiple documented
          occurrences on Record Ridge and within the proposed mine site (data
          freely available with the BC CDC). How will the province ensure that
          the ecosystem at Record Ridge is protected?
        </p>
        <h4>Safety</h4>
        <p>
          The safety of people driving, hiking, and cycling along the Cascade
          Highway has not been considered. “Highway” is a misnomer for this
          gravel road, designed, as one man who attended the Open House said,
          “for Model-T and horse-drawn wagon.” This road features narrow
          segments, blind corners, and precipitous drop-offs. In addition,
          increased truck traffic through the centre of town would further
          endanger the safety of drivers and pedestrians alike.
        </p>
        <h4>2-year pilot application for a 20+ year mining project</h4>
        <p>
          WHY (West High Yield Resources) has limited their application and the
          information provided to a 2-year pilot project with the extraction of
          only 249,000 tons of ore, to avoid the threshold of a large-scale
          environmental assessment. The proponents told the community that they
          intend to expand the mine site with additional applications after two
          years. The community would like to know, prior to any pilot, the full
          scope of the project and the effect it could have in their lives and
          future generations. The potential hidden social, environmental, and
          economic costs of this mine in the short and long term should be
          considered when planning this project that will affect the life of
          “Beautiful British Columbia” citizens. How can the province balance
          the right of the applicant to just a two-year mining proposal and
          ensure the local communities receive informed consent for a
          potentially longer-term and more invasive project?
        </p>
        <p>
          WHY mining company has no track record of successful, clean, and
          environmentally safe projects. The company did not represent
          themselves in a professional manner during the open house in Rossland,
          and have failed to demonstrate that they are a collaborative or
          trustworthy company. How will the province ensure that WHY Resources
          can be trusted to maintain the integrity of the proposed permit? What
          assurances can be given to the communities affected?
        </p>{" "}
        <p>
          The mine will need to put forward a reclamation security. The security
          is assessed on a site-specific basis and reflects the outstanding
          reclamation, environmental and closure obligations associated with the
          site. Please consider when defining the security, the social,
          environmental, and community economic impacts that the mine will
          incur, not only the site impact. Extracted from WHY website: “We are
          committed to a sustainable future and to improving the social,
          economic, and environmental well-being of the community.”
