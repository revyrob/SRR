# Save Record Ridge Front End Website

Save Record Ridge website was created for the SaveRecordRidge group in Rossland, BC who is protesting and bringing awareness to the proposed open pit mine located 10km away from Rossland, BC.  The website brings information, media links, and concerns to citizens so that citizens can make their own decisions about the proposed open pit mine.  The website is a built with the React framework and uses a couple of libraries such as: Tailwind, Framer Motion, MUI, React-router, and React-audio-player.  The website was required within a short time period (less than 1 week) and I interacted with the group via Slack to meet requirments.
